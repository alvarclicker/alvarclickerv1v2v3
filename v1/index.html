editorial note. 6/9/22 eventually hopefully soon like before i go on vacation on the 18th i will have lauched version 2 of alvar clicker. why you might ask that this is such a huge jump is that it will be a entire remodel of the website there will be seperate units with their own costs show how much they cost and would not be a rip off of cookie clicker. this will in fact to start will be harder then cookie clicker. i will also install a self uniting system where i can make it increase of decrease on what ever i feel i could make it the same as cookie clicker (1.15) or i could make it like 1.46 or something random. i also could change it by unit like one is 1.17 and another 1.43 another 1.24 and so on. the problem is that if i dont do it before my vacation i may not work on it until school starts up again in 3 months so yeah. hope you enjoy the game. i think its a fun one and to click on the picture of alvar and the chipmunks. also for people that want there own clicker game i could create one for you for a wallet refil just sayin. i liked the 19:20s becase 20s were all over for 20 year olds 20 20 20. puttin it out there

<br>
version 1.0785     
public anouncement i am aware that pretty much no one is really playing this game but if you are by the end of the year i will launch version 2.0!! i kno right!?! it is taking a lot long to keep and maintain this game so yeah. version 2 will have seperate units do seperate things with a more organized manner unlitmited units and it will tell you how much each unit costs. also if you ever see alvar in school tell him he looks like alvin from alvin and the chipmunks.
